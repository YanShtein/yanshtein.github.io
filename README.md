Hi there!
My name is Yana Shtein & I am learning to becomne a Front End developer.

My page was initially written in huge amounts of HTML, CSS, and JS.
As I learned more and got more advanced in coding, I decided its time to rewrite the page with React.
It all became more readable & cleaner as it was arranged into components and pros :)
